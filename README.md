# The Melian Dialogue Today: Power, Ethics, and the Nigerian Dream

> “The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.” – Thucydides

## Overview

This project is a modern reinterpretation of Thucydides’ *Melian Dialogue*, applied to the modern Nigerian experience. It examines the parallels between ancient Athenian imperialism and present-day systemic hardship in Nigeria.

Through classical critique, storytelling, and social reflection, this project seeks to illuminate the misuse of power, the cost of survival, and the tension between ethics and necessity.

Born from my studies in **Classical Political Thought** and **International Relations**, this project is both personal and principled. It reflects my belief that ancient wisdom remains vital—especially when it can help us see our world, our pain, and our potential more clearly.
