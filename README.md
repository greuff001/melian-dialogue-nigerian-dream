# The Melian Dialogue Today: Power, Ethics, and the Nigerian Dream

> “The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”  
> – Thucydides, *History of the Peloponnesian War*

## I. Prologue

In a time where empires are disguised as democracies and survival has become synonymous with surrender, the voice of Thucydides echoes still. The Melian Dialogue—a conversation between the powerful Athenians and the doomed Melians—remains one of the most haunting illustrations of political realism, ethical compromise, and the silence of the oppressed.

Today, I find this dialogue alive again, not on the Aegean shores, but in the streets of Nigeria.

This essay is a bridge between eras—between marble columns and makeshift rooftops, between philosophical debate and real, lived suffering. It is my attempt to mirror the ancient with the modern, to show that the plight of the Melians is not buried in time. It has simply changed names.

## II. The Ancient Parallel

The Melian Dialogue unfolds in Thucydides’ *History of the Peloponnesian War*. The mighty Athenians confront the small island of Melos, demanding surrender. The Melians plead for justice, neutrality, and the gods’ protection. But the Athenians speak with cold reason: “The strong do what they can; the weak suffer what they must.”

It is a clash of ideals: morality versus pragmatism. Hope versus logic. In the end, Melos resists—and is destroyed.

This was not merely a war—it was a revelation of how power speaks when it no longer needs to pretend.

## III. The Nigerian Reality

In modern Nigeria, we are all Melians.

Citizens navigate an unrelenting landscape of hardship—economic suffocation, political indifference, social decay. We appeal to reason, to justice, to leaders who profess democracy. Yet what do we hear in return? Silence, or worse—a mockery of hope.

We suffer under the shadow of institutionalized force, not always with guns, but with neglect, bureaucracy, and blatant corruption. The systems that govern us are too often unaccountable and unchecked, behaving with the confidence of Athens and the disregard of tyrants.

Power is no longer hidden. It is worn proudly, while dignity is sold for survival.

## IV. The Cost of Compromise

Like the Melians, Nigerians often choose endurance over rebellion—not out of cowardice, but because the cost of resistance is unbearable. Yet, even in surrender, we are not spared. What dignity remains when survival demands the sacrifice of virtue?

This is the soul of our crisis: the erosion of the moral will. A people denied both justice and the right to speak truth without fear will eventually forget how to dream.

Melos was razed. Not because they resisted—but because they believed that neutrality was still a shield. Today, neutrality has become complicity, and silence is no longer safety.

## V. The Way Forward

Thucydides did not write to glorify Athens. He wrote to warn the world. If we are to learn from Melos, we must first ask: Who is our Athens? What ideals have we compromised in the name of “what works”? What hope remains in the Nigerian Dream?

There is a need for a return to conscience—where ethics are not the language of the weak, but the backbone of the strong.

This project is my whisper into that storm. It is a call not for revolt, but for remembrance. For if history must repeat, let it not rhyme with despair. Let it echo with resolve.

Let the Melians speak again—and this time, let someone listen.
